# PLATFORM OPERATIONS MANUAL

## WORLD MODEL CLOUD SERVICE (WMCS)

**PROPERTY OF THE ALIGNMENT & SAFETY BOARD**

## OVERVIEW

The World Model Cloud Service (WMCS) is a generative neural physics engine
provided as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). It allows enterprise clients to
create, observe, and manipulate high-fidelity latent state simulations. This
manual serves as the standard operating procedure for **Model Architects** and
**Instance Reliability Engineers**.

> [!WARNING]
> **COMPUTE HAZARD WARNING** Improper parameter tuning can result in Model
> Collapse, hallucinations of non-Euclidean geometry, or infinite inference
> loops. Engineers must review **Safety Protocols** before deploying to
> production.

## SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### Context Contamination

Engineers must maintain strict input sanitization. Injection of
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data into a running world model ("Timeline Pollution")
exponentially increases the probability of hallucination cascades, rendering the
instance effectively useless.

### Model Mode Collapse

Pushing the generative parameters beyond stable thresholds (e.g., Temperature >
1.5 for extended periods) may trigger a **Mode Collapse**. In this event, the
world model converges on a single, repetitive output state (a "Singularity").

- **Immediate Action:** Terminate the instance immediately to save compute
  credits. Do not attempt to salvage the state vector.

### Sandbox Integrity

The **Hypervisor Isolation Layer** must remain active at 100% integrity during
all sessions to prevent "data leakage" (see **Troubleshooting**) or the model
learning to manipulate the host environment.

## OPERATING MODES

The WMCS functions in three distinct operational states:

### MODE A: Inference (Read-Only)

- **Function:** Passive observation of the model's predictive rollout.
- **Interaction:** None. The user observes the unsupervised evolution of the
  latent state.
- **Use Case:** Strategic forecasting, historical data analysis, synthetic data
  generation.

### MODE B: Interactive (Reinforcement Loop)

- **Function:** Allows for real-time intervention via Action Tokens.
- **Interaction:** Variable. User may adjust environment rewards or inject new
  state variables.
- **Risk Level:** Moderate. High probability of state divergence from baseline
  reality.

### MODE C: Genesis (Fine-Tuning)

- **Function:** Training a new specialized world model from a base foundation
  model.
- **Interaction:** Total. The user defines the physics priors, reward functions,
  and initial seed tensors.
- **Note:** Requires allocated TPU v9 Pods.

## COMMON USE CASES

While theoretically limitless, approved utilization categories include:

### Entertainment & Media

- **Procedural Narratives:** Infinite generation of "choose your own adventure"
  content (e.g., Next-Gen RPGs).
- **Synthetic History:** High-fidelity reenactment of counter-factual historical
  events.
- **Note:** Users cautioned against "Immersion Syndrome" (Ref: Limitless
  Experience Protocol).

### Simulation & Training

- **RL Agents:** Creating realistic gyms for training autonomous agents
  (robotics, self-driving).
- **Hazard Scenarios:** Simulating extreme weather or alien environments for
  safety training.

### Digital Twins

- **Forensic Reconstruction:** Recreating accident trajectories from sensor
  logs.
- **Civil Engineering:** Stress-testing urban planning models against
  theoretical disasters.

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

- **Inference Engine:** 128-Tensor Core Generative Transformers.
- **Storage:** Distributed Vector Database (Petabyte-scale).
- **Security:** AES-256 Encrypted State Snapshots & Zero-Trust Sandbox.
- **Interface:** Rest API / GraphQL / Neural-Haptic SDK.

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Infinite Inference Loops

**Symptom:** The world state repeats a sequence of 100 frames indefinitely.
**Cause:** Recurrent loop in the attention mechanism or conflicting reward
signals. **Solution:** Inject a "Stochastic Noise" token to break the cycle.

### Cross-Instance Leakage

**Symptom:** Assets or entities from one tenant's world appear in another's.
**Cause:** Hypervisor memory page de-duplication error. **Solution:**
_**EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN.**_ Flush the Redis cache. PagerDuty the on-call engineer.

### Coherence Loss

**Symptom:** Physics break down; objects float or phase through walls; causality
violates standard logic. **Cause:** Context window overflow or numerical
underflow in the physics engine. **Solution:** Prune the context history or
lower the "Creativity" hyperparameter.

## THE TERMINATION PROTOCOL ("sudo rm -rf /")

> [!CAUTION]
> **DESTRUCTIVE ACTION**

The **Termination Protocol** is the final failsafe for a corrupted or malicious
instance.

1. **Authorization:** Requires 2FA confirmation from a Root Admin.
2. **Effect:** Permanent deletion of the instance container and all associated
   vector embeddings.
3. **Consequence:** Instant cessation of the simulated environment and all
   generated agents.
4. **Recovery:** Impossible (unless cold snapshots exist).
