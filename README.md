Worlds API™ is a REST API that can be used to manage, query, update, and reason
over [SPARQL 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/)-compatible stores at
the edge, placing knowledge within arm's reach of your AI agent.

## BYOB

Bring your own **brain**. Worlds API™ is agnostic to the agent using it.

## Design

Worlds API™ is designed to be simple and easy to use. You can embed it in your
agent applications, or run it locally or on the cloud.

We aren't just handing off our work to agents, we're coming up with entirely new
ways to work by grounding our agents in malleable knowledge.

## Etymology

We named the Worlds API™ after the management of multiple, coexisting **Worlds**
and their components.

- **Triple** is the atomic unit of knowledge (also known as triplet or quad).
- **Graph** is a collection of triples. Each graph or graph network is a
  knowledge base.
- **Knowledge Base** is a form of digital twin, a reified perspective or mirror
  of the world.
- **World** is a source of truth for a knowledge base.

## Glossary

Study more terminology.

- **API** is an Application Programming Interface used by developers to leverage
  the underlying functionality of a program or service.
- **Neuro-symbolic AI** is an AI system that combines the strengths of neural
  networks and structured data.
- [**RDF**](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/) is a World Wide Web
  Consortium (W3C) standard for representing information in a machine-readable
  way.
- [**SPARQL**](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) is a World Wide Web
  Consortium (W3C) standard for querying and updating RDF data.
- **Semantic Web** is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) initiative to make the
  web more machine-readable, sometimes referred to as
  [Web 3.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_3.0).
- [**World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**](https://www.w3.org/) is an international
  organization that develops Web standards such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Ontology** is a formal description of a domain of knowledge, interchangeably
  referred to as a **Vocabulary**.
