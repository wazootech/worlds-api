## Get started

Follow these steps to create your first world and run a query in under 5 minutes.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup credentials">
    To get started, you'll need an API key and a world ID. You can generate these in the [dashboard](https://console.wazoo.dev).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the SDK">

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npx jsr add @wazoo/sdk
```

```bash deno
deno add jsr:@wazoo/sdk
```

</CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Initialize the client">
    Create a new client instance using your API key.

```typescript
import { WorldsSdk } from "@wazoo/sdk";

const sdk = new WorldsSdk({
  baseUrl: "https://api.wazoo.dev/v1", // Adjust if using a different endpoint
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const worldId = "YOUR_WORLD_ID";
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add knowledge">
    Insert data into your world using SPARQL. This example adds a person and their job title.

Insert some data into your world using SPARQL.

```typescript
await sdk.worlds.sparql(
  worldId,
  `
  INSERT DATA {
    <http://example.org/ethan> <http://schema.org/name> "Ethan" .
    <http://example.org/ethan> <http://schema.org/jobTitle> "Software Engineer" .
  }
`,
);
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Query knowledge">
    Retrieve the data you just added to verify the insertion was successful.

Retrieve the data you just added.

```typescript
const result = await sdk.worlds.sparql(
  worldId,
  `
  SELECT ?name ?title WHERE {
    ?person <http://schema.org/name> ?name ;
            <http://schema.org/jobTitle> ?title .
  }
`,
);

console.log(result);
```

    <Check>
      Verify that the `result` contains the name "Ethan" and the title "Software Engineer".
    </Check>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Search">
    Perform a semantic search to find information based on meaning rather than exact keywords.

Perform a semantic search.

```typescript
const searchResults = await sdk.worlds.search(
  worldId,
  "Who is the software engineer?",
);
console.log(searchResults);
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

Now that you've run your first query, explore the [core concepts](/concepts/worlds) or dive into the [API reference](/api-reference/worlds/list).
