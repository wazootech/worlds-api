description: "How to authenticate requests to the Worlds API"
---

The Worlds API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. You must include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Generating an API key

<Note>
  You must have a valid API key before you can make requests to the API.
</Note>

- **Cloud**: Generate an API key in the [dashboard](https://console.wazoo.dev/settings).
- **Self-hosted**: Use the `ADMIN_API_KEY` configured in your server's environment variables.

## Usage

### Header format

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### SDK example

The SDK handles authentication for you automatically when you initialize the client.

```typescript
import { WorldsSdk } from "@wazoo/sdk";

const sdk = new WorldsSdk({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  // baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000/v1", // Optional: Defaults to Cloud API
});
```

## Admin access

Certain endpoints, such as listing all worlds for an account, require an admin API key. If you are self-hosting, this is the same as your `ADMIN_API_KEY`.
