## Monorepo structure

| Package           | Description                               |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `packages/server` | The core REST API implementation.         |
| `packages/sdk`    | Official TypeScript/Deno client.          |
| `packages/cli`    | Command-line tool for managing instances. |
| `packages/docs`   | This documentation site (Mintlify).       |

## Global tasks

Common tasks can be run from the root of the repository:

- **Start CLI**: `deno task start:cli`
- **Start Server**: `deno task start:server`
- **Format code**: `deno task fmt`
- **Lint code**: `deno task lint`
- **Run tests**: `deno task test`
- **Pre-commit check**: `deno task precommit`

## Data Ingestion & Lifecycle

Adding knowledge (often referred to as "memories" in agentic contexts) to the Worlds ecosystem can be achieved through multiple entry points, depending on your environment and use case.

### 1. Management Console

The easiest way to ingest data during development is through the **Console UI**.

- **Batch Upload**: Drag and drop JSON-LD or Turtle files directly into a World.
- **Manual Entry**: Edit triples directly in the Graph Explorer for precise knowledge management.

### 2. Remote & Local API

For programmatic ingestion, use the REST API endpoints. This is the primary method for production applications.

- **`POST /v1/worlds/{id}/statements`**: Add individual or batches of RDF statements.
- **`POST /v1/worlds/{id}/import`**: Import entire datasets for initialization.

### 3. CLI Ingestion

The CLI can be used for local-first automation and CI/CD pipelines.

- **Background Tasks**: The CLI can trigger ingestion tasks that process local files and sync them to a remote or local World instance.
- **Persistence Reset**: Use the CLI to nuke and re-sync your local state during active development.

> [!NOTE]
> Regardless of the entry point, all data is stored as high-precision RDF triples, ensuring interoperability across the entire ecosystem.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ports already in use">
    The Console attempts to allocate ports starting from `8001`. If you have
    conflicting services or lingering processes, you can run:

    ```bash
    npm run nuke
    ```

    This will kill all local Deno processes and reset the development lock. Alternatively, you can manually adjust the `apiBaseUrl` in `data/workos.json` and restart the console.
