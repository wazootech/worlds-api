# Vibe Coding with Worlds

"Vibe Coding" is the practice of using AI agents (like Claude Code, Windsurf, or Cursor) to build applications through high-level intent rather than manual line-by-line coding. Worlds is uniquely suited for Vibe Coding because its state is semantic and malleable.

## The Agent Prompt

To help an AI agent integrate with Worlds, copy and paste the following "World-Aware" prompt into your agent's context:

```markdown
I am building an application using the Worlds API.
Worlds are persistent, semantic knowledge containers.

- Use the `@wazootech/worlds` SDK to interact with them.
- Every World has a `worldId`.
- You can store data as "Malleable Knowledge" which is automatically indexed and searchable.
- Use the `search` endpoint to retrieve context from a World.

When I ask you to "Remember X", call the Worlds API to store it.
When I ask a question about X, search the World for context first.
```

## Agent Integration Skills

If you are using **Claude Code**, you can add Worlds as a custom skill by providing it the OpenAPI spec:

1.  **Get your API Key**: From the [Worlds Console](https://console.wazoo.dev).
2.  **Mount the Spec**: Tell Claude to read `https://api.wazoo.dev/openapi.json`.
3.  **Command**: `claude "Help me build a personal memory world for my project."`

## Best Practices

- **Semantic Naming**: Give your Worlds descriptive names. The AI uses these names to choose the right container for context.
- **Verbose Connectors**: When setting up connectors, let the AI agent handle the configuration logic. It can often find the right OAuth scopes automatically.
- **Context Loops**: Always ask the agent to "check the world" at the start of a session.

## Examples

### Storing a Fact

"Hey Claude, remember that our project deadline is March 15th."
_Result: Claude calls the SDK to update the World state._

### Semantic Search

"What's the status of our project?"
_Result: Claude searches the World and retrieves the March 15th deadline._
