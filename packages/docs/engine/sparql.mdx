**SPARQL** (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) is the standard query language for graph data. Worlds API supports the full [SPARQL Endpoint](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/) specification.

## Why SPARQL?

Unlike vector search, which gives you approximate matches based on meaning, SPARQL allows you to ask precise, structured questions about your data.

- **Exact Pattern Matching**: Find exactly the nodes that fit the pattern.
- **Joins**: Connect data across multiple relationships.
- **Filtering**: Apply complex logic to filter results.

## Example

Find all people who know "Ethan":

```sparql
SELECT ?personName WHERE {
  ?person <http://schema.org/knows> <http://example.org/ethan> .
  ?person <http://schema.org/name> ?personName .
}
```
