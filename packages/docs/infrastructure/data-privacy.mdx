We believe in data transparency. This guide explains exactly where your information lives depending on your deployment mode.

### Local Development (Ollama/SQLite)

In local development mode, **no data ever leaves your machine**.

- **Metadata**: Stored in a local `.db` file in your repository.
- **Embeddings**: Generated via **Ollama** running on your local GPU/CPU.
- **Privacy**: 100% private and air-gapped.

### Standalone Server (Self-Hosted)

When you self-host a Worlds API Server:

- **Metadata**: Stored in your specified `LIBSQL_URL` (could be local or a private Turso instance).
- **Embeddings**: If using **OpenRouter**, text snippets are sent to their API for vectorization. If using **Ollama**, it remains private.

### Managed Platform (Console)

When using the full Management Console:

- **Auth Data**: Managed by **WorkOS** (SSO/AuthKit).
- **Orchestrated Worlds**: Each world gets its own dedicated **Turso** database and **Deno Deploy** worker.
- **Data Residency**: You can choose your Turso/Deno regions during organization setup to ensure data proximity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Worlds Platform™ does not "phone home" or collect telemetry from self-hosted instances. Your data is your own.
