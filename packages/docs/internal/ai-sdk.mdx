The `@wazoo/worlds-ai-sdk` package provides a set of tools designed to bridge the gap between Large Language Models (LLMs) and structured RDF knowledge. These tools are located in `packages/ai-sdk/tools`.

## Core tools

### `discover-schema`

Introspects a world's graph to identify available classes, properties, and their relationships. This is essential for providing agents with the "vocabulary" of a specific world before they attempt to query it.

- **Usage**: Typically called during the agent's initialization or first-encounter with a world.
- **Benefit**: Redues hallucinations by grounding the agent in the actual schema of the graph.

### `execute-sparql`

Provides a safe interface for agents to execute SPARQL `SELECT` and `ASK` queries.

- **Usage**: The agent generates a SPARQL query based on the user's intent and executes it via this tool.
- **Safety**: Restricts query types and prevents unauthorized access to the underlying database.

### `generate-iri`

A utility for generating semantically meaningful Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs).

- **Usage**: Used when creating new entities or properties within a world to ensure consistency and adherence to RDF standards.

### `search-entities`

Integrates the hybrid search (Vector + FTS) capabilities of the Worlds API.

- **Usage**: Allows agents to perform semantic search across triples and chunks.
- **Precision**: Returns a ranked list of entities that match the semantic or keyword criteria.

## Integration

These tools are designed to be compatible with popular agent frameworks like the **Vercel AI SDK**, allowing you to expose them as standard "tools" that the model can call autonomously.
