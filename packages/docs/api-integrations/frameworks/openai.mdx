# OpenAI Integration

Using Worlds with the standard OpenAI SDK is straightforward. You can use it either as a standalone context provider or as a function calling tool.

## Installation

```bash
npm install openai @wazootech/worlds
```

## Option 1: Tool Calling (Recommended)

Let the model decide when it needs to "remember" or "search" for information.

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { Worlds } from "@wazootech/worlds";

const openai = new OpenAI();
const worlds = new Worlds({ apiKey: process.env.WORLDS_API_KEY });

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "What is our project status?" }],
  tools: [
    {
      type: "function",
      function: {
        name: "search_world",
        description: "Search the semantic world for project context.",
        parameters: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            query: { type: "string" },
          },
          required: ["query"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

## Option 2: Pre-fetch Context

Perform a search before calling OpenAI to provide the model with "immediate" memory.

```typescript
const context = await worlds.search("my-world-id", { query: "project status" });

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a project manager. Use this context: ${JSON.stringify(context)}`,
    },
    { role: "user", content: "What is our project status?" },
  ],
});
```
