# Vercel AI SDK Integration

The Vercel AI SDK is a powerful framework for building AI applications. You can use Worlds to provide persistent, semantic context to your `generateText` and `streamText` calls.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @wazootech/worlds ai
```

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to integrate Worlds is to use it as a tool that the model can call to search for context.

```typescript
import { generateText, tool } from "ai";
import { Worlds } from "@wazootech/worlds";
import { z } from "zod";

const worlds = new Worlds({ apiKey: process.env.WORLDS_API_KEY });

const result = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  system:
    "You are a helpful assistant with access to a persistent memory world.",
  tools: {
    searchMemory: tool({
      description: "Search the personal memory world for context.",
      parameters: z.object({
        query: z.string().description("The search query"),
      }),
      execute: async ({ query }) => {
        const results = await worlds.search("your-world-id", { query });
        return results;
      },
    }),
  },
  prompt: "What did we talk about last time?",
});
```

## Automatic Context Injection

For a more seamless experience, you can inject World context into the system prompt automatically.

```typescript
const context = await worlds.search("your-world-id", {
  query: userPrompt,
  limit: 3,
});

const result = await generateText({
  model: yourModel,
  system: `You are a helpful assistant. Use this context if relevant: ${JSON.stringify(context)}`,
  prompt: userPrompt,
});
```
