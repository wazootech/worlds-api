description: "Interact with `worlds-api` using the official TypeScript SDK"
---

The **Worlds API SDK** is the most powerful way to interact with your knowledge graph. While the [Quickstart](/developer-platform/getting-started/quickstart) covers the basics, the SDK provides advanced tools for semantic reasoning and agentic workflows.

## Feature Highlights

### 1. Type-Safe SPARQL

The SDK handles the plumbing of SPARQL requests, including authentication and response parsing, while keeping your queries type-safe.

```typescript
const result = await sdk.worlds.sparql(
  worldId,
  `
  SELECT ?name WHERE {
    ?person <http://schema.org/name> ?name .
  }
`,
);
```

### 2. Hybrid Search

Combine vector similarity with full-text search. This is ideal for finding information when you only have a vague concept or a natural language question.

```typescript
const searchResults = await sdk.worlds.search(worldId, "conceptual question");
```

### 3. AI Tool-Calling

The SDK exposes your Worlds as tools that adhere to the standard [AI SDK tool interface](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/tools), making them directly compatible with various LLM orchestrators (like Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, and others) to allow agents to "read and write" to the graph.

## Configuration Options

When initializing the client, you can customize retry logic, custom headers, and timeout behaviors:

```typescript
const sdk = new WorldsSdk({
  baseUrl: "https://api.wazoo.dev/v1",
  apiKey: "your-api-key",
  // Advanced configuration
  fetch: customFetchFn,
});
```
