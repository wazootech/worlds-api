description: "How to authenticate requests to the Worlds API"
---

The Worlds API uses **Bearer Token** authentication. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request.

## Generate an API key

<Note>A valid API key is required to make requests to the API.</Note>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Cloud">
    Generate an API key in the [dashboard](https://console.wazoo.dev/settings).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Self-hosted">
    Use the `WORLDS_API_KEY` configured in your server's environment. This acts
    as the **Root Admin Key** for your instance and is typically managed by your
    provisioner.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use unprotected mode

For rapid prototyping and local development, the `WORLDS_API_KEY` is **optional**.

> [!WARNING]
> If you do not provide a `WORLDS_API_KEY`, the server will run in **unprotected mode**, granting full administrative access to all requests. This state is strictly intended for local development.

## Authenticate requests

### Set the Header

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Use the SDK

The SDK handles authentication automatically when you initialize the client.

```typescript
import { WorldsSdk } from "@wazoo/worlds-sdk";

const sdk = new WorldsSdk({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:8000",
});
```

## Access Admin features

Certain endpoints, such as listing all worlds for an account, require an admin API key. If you are self-hosting, this is your `WORLDS_API_KEY`.
