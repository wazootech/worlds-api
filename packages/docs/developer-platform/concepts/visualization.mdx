While the Worlds API is local-first and headless by default, the **Symbolic State** of a World is inherently spatial. Visualizing the relationships (triples) within a World is critical for debugging agentic reasoning and understanding the "shape" of your knowledge base.

## The Mental Model

In Worlds, your data isn't a table; it's a **Directed Graph**.

- **Nodes**: Subjects and Objects (Entities).
- **Edges**: Predicates (Relationships).

## Visualizing via the Console

The fastest way to see your World is through the **Worlds Management Console**.

- **Graph Explorer**: A force-directed graph view where you can click nodes to expand their relationships.
- **Query Inspector**: Visualize the results of [SPARQL Select](/api-reference/basics/sparql-query) queries as interactive tables or JSON-LD trees.

## Custom Visualization (SDK)

If you are building a custom UI or agentic dashboard, you can use the [TypeScript SDK](/getting-started/sdk-index) to pull graph data and feed it into modern visualization libraries.

### 1. D3.js / Force-Directed Graphs

Perfect for large-scale social graphs or complex supply chains. You can map `Subject -> Object` as link pairs.

### 2. React-Flow / Cytoscape

Ideal for "Chain of Thought" or memory block visualization, where entities are represented as nodes in a controllable canvas.

### 3. Kinopio-Style Spatial Thinking

Inspired by tools like **Kinopio**, you can treat Worlds as a "Spatial Canvas" where an agent organizes its thoughts as cards and connections.

## Why Visualize?

1.  **Hallucination Debugging**: If an agent reaches a wrong conclusion, visualizing the "path" it took through the graph can reveal missing or incorrect triples.
2.  **Breadth Discovery**: Seeing the density of connections helps you identify "Knowledge Hubs" (nodes with many predicates) that might be over-weighted in RAG context.
3.  **Audit Trails**: Show human operators exactly which facts were used to generate an agent's response.
