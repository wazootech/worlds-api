A **World** is an isolated container for knowledge. It is the fundamental unit of organization in the Worlds API.

## Anatomy of a World

Each World consists of:

- **Metadata**: Name, description, and configuration.
- **RDF Store**: A high-performance triple store containing the world's knowledge graph.
- **Vector Store**: An embedding index that enables semantic search over the knowledge graph.

## Isolation

Worlds are completely isolated from one another. Data inserted into one world cannot be queried from another, ensuring strict data separation for different agents or contexts.

## Edge Deployment

Worlds are designed to live at the edge. The underlying storage and query engine are optimized for low-latency access, making them ideal for real-time AI applications.
