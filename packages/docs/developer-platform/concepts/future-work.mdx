description: "The roadmap for expanding the Worlds Ecosystem breadth."
---

Worlds is an evolving neuro-symbolic platform. Based on our ecosystem analysis and comparative mapping with modern agentic platforms, the following "missing puzzle pieces" are targeted for future development.

## 1. Automated Lifecycle & Syncing

We aim to move from manual ingestion to automated, persistent state management.

- **Folder Watcher**: A CLI mode that monitors local directories and automatically ingests new files/changes into a target World.
- **Scheduled Sync**: Automated periodic pulls from external data sources (Turso remote, REST APIs) to keep knowledge bases fresh.

## 2. Advanced Semantic Tagging

While RDF predicates provide infinite flexibility, we are developing a standardized **Semantic Tagging Specification**.

- **Container Tags**: High-level metadata for categorizing Worlds and Organizations.
- **Inference Rules**: Automatic tagging of triples based on logical patterns (e.g., automatically tagging any persona-related triple).

## 3. Visualization & Observability

Making the "Invisible engine" visible.

- **Graph Visualization Guide**: Reference implementations for rendering Worlds data using D3.js, Cytoscape, or React-Force-Graph.
- **Live Query Inspector**: A browser-based tool to watch SPARQL queries execute in real-time.

## 4. Ecosystem Expansion

- **VS Code Extension**: Direct SPARQL editing and World management within your IDE.
- **Python SDK**: Broadening the toolchain for the data science and AI research communities.
