description: "How state is stored on your local filesystem."
---

During local development, all state is stored in the `packages/console/data` directory. This directory mirrors the resource hierarchy (Organizations > Worlds) using the local filesystem.

```text
packages/console/data/
├── workos.json           # Mock database for Organizations and Users
└── {org_id}/             # Root directory for a specific Organization
    ├── worlds.db         # Primary libSQL DB (registry of worlds for the org)
    └── worlds/           # Directory for individual World databases
        └── {world_id}.db # Secondary libSQL DB (triples & embeddings for a world)
```

## Resetting state

To wipe all local data and start fresh, simply delete the contents of the `packages/console/data` directory.

## Modifying existing user data

If you want to change the identity of your local user _after_ the initial setup, you can directly edit `packages/console/data/workos.json`.

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "admin",
    "email": "admin@wazoo.dev",
    "firstName": "System",
    "lastName": "Admin",
    "profilePictureUrl": null,
    "metadata": {
      "admin": "true"
    }
  },
  "organizations": []
}
```

Changes made to this file will be reflected in the Console upon the next request.
