The fastest way to experience neuro-symbolic knowledge is through the **Worlds Management Console**. No code required.

## Get Started

Follow these steps to create your first World and run a semantic search.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Account">
    Visit [console.wazoo.dev](https://console.wazoo.dev) and sign up. You'll be prompted to create your first **Organization** to begin.
  </Step>

<Step title="Provision a World">
  In your organization dashboard under **My Worlds**, click on **"Create
  World"**. - Give it a name (e.g., "My First World"). - Click **Create**. Your
  World will be provisioned instantly.
</Step>

  <Step title="Add Knowledge">
    Select your world and navigate to the **SPARQL** tab. Paste the following triples into the editor to define a simple concept:

    ```sparql
    INSERT DATA {
      <http://example.org/ethan> <http://schema.org/name> "Ethan" .
      <http://example.org/ethan> <http://schema.org/jobTitle> "Software Engineer" .
    }
    ```
    Click **Execute**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Run a Semantic Search">
    Head over to the **Search** tab. Type a natural language question like:
    
    > "Find the software engineer"

    The Worlds Platform uses its underlying vector embeddings to find the most relevant nodes. Click **Search Triples** to see the results.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

Now that you've experienced Worlds via the UI, you're ready to integrate it into your own applications.
