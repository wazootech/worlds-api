## Overview

**Worlds API™** is a managed neuro-symbolic infrastructure layer designed to query and reason over [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-overview/)-compatible knowledge bases at the edge. We place malleable, high-precision knowledge within arm's reach of your **agentic workflows** and **autonomous assistants**.

We operate on the concept of **Worlds**—isolated, queryable knowledge bases that your agents can interact with.

## Modular design

The Worlds Platform™ is highly modularized to support everything from **local-first** development to **cloud-native** production environments. This is achieved through a **hot-swappable architecture** using **polymorphism** for dependency injection, ensuring that you can pivot between deployment strategies without changing your application logic.

- **Local-First**: Run the API Server and Console entirely on your machine with SQLite for zero-latency development.
- **Hybrid**: Mix and match components, like using a local Console with a remote Turso-backed API.
- **Cloud-Native**: Deploy to the edge with Deno Deploy and Turso for a globally distributed, scalable intelligence layer.

This modularity cultivates a rich technical ecosystem that serves as the foundation for powerful AI-driven features.
