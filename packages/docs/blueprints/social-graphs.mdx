The Worlds Platform™ is ideal for modeling complex relationships. By using RDF triples, you can build social graphs that are more flexible than traditional SQL schemas.

## Modeling Connections

In a World, you can represent users and their relationships as triples. For example, to say "Alice follows Bob":

```turtle
:alice :follows :bob .
:alice a :User .
:bob a :User .
```

## Finding "Friends of Friends"

One of the strengths of SPARQL is the ability to perform complex graph traversals. Here is a query to find all people that Alice's friends follow, who Alice doesn't already follow:

```sparql
PREFIX : <http://example.org/>

SELECT DISTINCT ?fof
WHERE {
  :alice :follows ?friend .
  ?friend :follows ?fof .
  FILTER (?fof != :alice)
  FILTER NOT EXISTS { :alice :follows ?fof }
}
```

## Visualizing the Graph

In the **Console**, you can use the **Graph Explorer** to see these connections visually. This helps in auditing relationships or identifying clusters of users in your network.
