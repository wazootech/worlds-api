Worlds API™ is designed with an **Edge-First** philosophy. By leveraging the power of **Deno** and **Turso**, we move the symbolic reasoning layer as close to your users (and agents) as physically possible.

## The Latency of Intelligence

In a traditional architecture, an AI agent often has to perform multiple round-trips:

1.  **Agent -> LLM**: Probability extraction.
2.  **Agent -> Database (Centralized)**: Fact retrieval.
3.  **Agent -> SDK**: Logic processing.

When your database is centralized in a single region (e.g., `us-east-1`), an agent running in Europe or Asia suffers hundreds of milliseconds of latency on every knowledge lookup. In a multi-step agentic loop, this latency compounds, making autonomous assistants feel slow and "laggy."

## The World at the Edge

By deploying Worlds at the edge, we achieve **Global Resonance**:

### 1. Zero-Latency Knowledge

Using **Turso**, we replicate your World's symbolic state to edge regions globally. When an agent in Tokyo queries a World, it hits a local replica. Knowledge retrieval happens in milliseconds, not hundreds.

### 2. Deno Native

The Worlds API Server is built on **Deno**, the most performant runtime for edge compute. This allows for near-instant cold starts and highly efficient handling of concurrent SPARQL queries.

### 3. Isolated Reasoning

Each World is an isolated primitive. You can deploy specific knowledge bases to specific regions based on where your agents are operating, ensuring data residency and performance are optimized.

## Architecture Checklist

To get the most out of the Edge Story, follows these best practices:

- **Deploy to Deno Deploy**: Use our managed or self-hosted edge templates.
- **Use Turso Remote**: Connect your API Server to a Turso database with global replication enabled.
- **Local-First Sync**: Develop locally with a local SQLite file, then push to the edge with a single CLI task.
